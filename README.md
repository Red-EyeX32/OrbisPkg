## OrbisPkg
OrbisPkg is a tool that will enable you to view/edit contents of a retail and/or fake package, display various information and properties about the package, and compile your own package.

## Motivation
The PlayStation 4 homebrew community is making a steady comeback and being that the ".pkg" format is the main container for mostly everything related to downloadable and installable content, most people will use Sony's proprietary tools to manage package files. This project will eliminate the usage of Sony's tools and will encourage the open source effort for the PlayStation 4 platform.
